# Download comics

This is a program for downloading pictures and extracting information
about a comic from http://www.acg456.com/ for personal interests.
Regular expresssions are used to match Particular section of a page.
I understand that the design of this program is not so good since it
hardwires strings to some extent but it serves the functionality.

This is an updated version. The original version is not suitable for
the purpose due to the reformation of the website since the execution
of this program requires exact match of particular contents.

To run this program, be sure that the server and PHP are configured
properly and then simply try to reach this file from any browser through
localhost (eg. `http://localhost/download-comics/index.php`).
